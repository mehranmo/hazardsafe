*   **Class 1:** Explosives
*   **Class 7:** Radioactive Materials

## Section 2: Specific Requirements for Class 7 (Radioactive)
**2.1 Ambient Conditions**
*   **Temperature:** For Type B(U) packages, the ambient temperature during transport must not exceed 38°C (100°F) unless the package allows for higher temperatures as specified in its Certificate of Compliance.
*   **Pressure:** The containment system must retain integrity under a reduction of ambient pressure to 60 kPa (0.60 bar).

**2.2 Separation Distances**
Packages must be separated from occupied areas by at least:
*   2 meters for Transport Index (TI) < 1.0
*   4 meters for TI >= 1.0 and < 5.0

**2.3 Contamination Limits**
Non-fixed contamination on the external surfaces of any package shall not exceed:
*   4 Bq/cm2 for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters.
*   0.4 Bq/cm2 for all other alpha emitters.

## Section 3: Emergency Response
**3.1 Leaking Packages**
If a package is found to be leaking:
1.  Isolate the area for at least 50 meters in all directions.
2.  Notify the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) immediately.
3.  Do not touch the package without protective gear.
